## Anthony Zamora Portfolio 

Welcome to my portfolio page! This is a work in progress. I will continue to add to this as I learn more in class. I decided to dedicate focus on using Tailwinds CSS. This seems like a good CSS framework to work with for the remainder of the bootcamp and beyond.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS
- Tailwinds CSS Framework
